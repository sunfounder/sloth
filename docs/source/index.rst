This cute learning kit focuses on the popular open source platform Arduino. 
You can learn the knowledge of the Arduino servo and ultrasonic ranging module by applying this kit.

It is a new mobile robot called Sloth developed by SunFounder. 
Each leg has 2 joints driven by servo. 
One 9V chargeable lithium batteries are to supply the bot when the SunFounder Nano is used as the control board, compatible with the Arduino Nano. 
A servo control board connects with the batteries, servos, SunFounder Nano, 
and the HC-SR04 ultrasonic ranging module. 
Sloth can move forward and detect the range to make a turn when encountering an obstacle. In addition, when learning to program, you can also have the fun to build a pretty cool bio-robot by yourself.

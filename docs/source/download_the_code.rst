Download the Code
=================

We have uploaded the relevant code material to github, you can download it through the link below.

* :download:`Sloth <https://github.com/sunfounder/sloth-kit/archive/refs/heads/main.zip>`


Then, you can see 2 folders. 

* ``DIY_4-DOF_Robot_Kit_-_Sloth``: It is recommended to download this package first, including the Arduino code, drivers, library, schematic and user manual.

* ``How_to_use_Sloth_with_Mixly``: This is an extended use of Sloth via graphical programming software - Mixly to program. The manual contains only a basic introduction to Mixly and how to program in Mixly, but does not include hardware assembly part, you need to check :ref:`Assembly` first, and after Sloth is completely assembled, you can use Mixly for programming.

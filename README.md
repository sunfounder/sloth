This cute learning kit focuses on the popular open source platform Arduino. You can learn the knowledge of the Arduino servo and ultrasonic ranging module by applying this kit.

It is a new type of mobile robot called Sloth developed by SunFounder. Each leg has 2 servo-driven joints. It can move forward, backward, and steer, and can combine a variety of other movements that you can choreograph into a dance. It is also equipped with HC-SR04 ultrasonic distance measurement module, can complete the obstacle avoidance movement, follow the movement and other functions.
